  # strictly by sequence number. If a sequence number is missing the query is delayed up 
  # to the configured `delayed-event-timeout` and if the expected event is still not 
  # found the stream is completed with failure. This means that there must not be any 
  # holes in the sequence numbers for a given tag, i.e. all events must be tagged
